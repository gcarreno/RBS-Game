A very simple attempt at a Rock-Paper-Scissors game.

This was part of a friendly challenge to have many ways to deal with images in a Delphi/Lazarus app.

1. @[Luigizi](https://github.com/Luigizi) implemented getting the images from files on the hard drive: [RockPaperScissorsGame](https://github.com/Luigizi/RockPaperScissorsGame)
2. @[KodeZwerg](https://github.com/KodeZwerg) implemented getting the images from embedded resources: [RockPaperScissor](https://github.com/KodeZwerg/RockPaperScissor)
3. Me, I implemented it using a `TImageList`.

Enjoy our little playground results.
